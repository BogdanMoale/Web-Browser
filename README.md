# Web-Browser

MyWebBrowser" application is a simple, lightweight web browser built using C# and Windows Forms. This user-friendly browser allows users to browse the internet using multiple tabs, similar to popular web browsers. Each tab represents a separate webpage, and users can navigate to different URLs, go back and forward in their browsing history, and add or remove tabs as needed. The browser displays the title of the currently loaded webpage on the respective tab, making it easy to manage multiple pages simultaneously. The application provides a basic web browsing experience with essential features, making it suitable for users who prefer a straightforward and uncomplicated browsing tool. However, it's important to note that the application's functionalities may not be as extensive as those of mainstream browsers, as it is primarily intended for educational purposes or as a starting point for more sophisticated web browser projects.
